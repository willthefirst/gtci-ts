  how do we initialize minLength?

k: 5
arr: [1, 2, 3, 1]
minLength = this would start as the array size UNLESS its sum < k.
windowStart = 0

--
arr: [1, 2, 3, 1]
      *******
minLength: 3. 
windowStart: 0
windowSum: 3;
i: 2

iterate through the array, growing and shrinking the window accordingly...
    if (windowSum + arr[i]) < k
      add arr[i] to windowSum, 
      increment i.
    else
      minLength = min(minlength, (i - windowStart + 1))
